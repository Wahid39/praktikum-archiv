Description

With this little tool, you can detect stuck or dead pixels and also repair them. Many tools like this can be found all over the internet, but we could not find a tool with all the functions in one. Therefore, an adequate application was created, called Rizonesoft Pixel Repair.

Before we continue with what you can do with Rizonesoft Pixel Repair, let us start with what you cannot do. First of all, you can only attempt to repair stuck pixels and it will not repair dead pixels. Secondly, it will not work every time either. No miracles here boys and girls.

Now let’s get to the good part. You can use the Dead pixel locator section on Rizonesoft Pixel Repair to look for dead or stuck pixels. You can also use this section to help you find dirty little spots and dust when you clean your screen (Because dust doesn’t show on all colors).

Now, after you have located stuck pixels, try to repair them with this tool. Set the color mode, press go and place the flashy window thingy under the stuck pixel. Sometimes this unsticks that pixel, but as stated before, not always.
